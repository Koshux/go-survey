# Quiz App

The Quiz App is a comprehensive solution for creating and taking quizzes, built on a scalable architecture that utilizes `Vue 3`, `Pinia`, `Go`, `SurveyJS`, and `vue-i18n` for a multi-lingual experience. It offers nuanced feedback on quiz performance, integrating fuzzy logic assessments.

## Overview

This project is divided into two main parts: the frontend, for user interaction, and the backend, for data management and logic processing. It supports multi-lingual content, providing an inclusive user experience.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Lingual Support**: Users can take quizzes in their preferred language.
- **Nuanced Feedback**: Utilizes fuzzy logic for detailed performance categories.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, ready for future enhancements like database integration and dynamic quiz management.

## Limitations and Performance

- **In-Memory Storage**: Currently relies on in-memory storage, requiring database integration for persistence and scalability.
- **Fuzzy Logic Performance**: The nuanced feedback system introduces complexity, requiring careful management to ensure performance and scalability.

## Future Directions

- **White-Labeling**: Architectural design allows for transformation into a white-labeled quiz maker platform, catering to various clients and use cases.
- **Detailed Review and Dockerization**: Planned enhancements include detailed review capabilities and Dockerization for streamlined deployment.

## Getting Started

Refer to individual README.md files in the `frontend` and `backend` directories for setup and running instructions.

## Scalability and Growth

Future versions will focus on transforming the Quiz App into a fully-fledged, white-labeled quiz maker, supporting extensive customization and serving a wide range of use cases. Possible improvements include database integration, user authentication, and dynamic quiz management features.
